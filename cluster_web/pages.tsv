https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles	good articles in wikipediaa good article (ga) is an article that meets a core set of editorial standards but is not featured article quality. good articles meet the good article criteria, passing through the good article nomination process successfully. they are well written, contain factually accurate and verifiable information, are broad in coverage, neutral in point of view, stable, and illustrated, where possible, by relevant images with suitable copyright licenses. good articles do not have to be as comprehensive as featured articles, but they should not omit any major facets of the topic: a comparison of the criteria for good and featured articles describes further differences.currently, out of the 6,012,050 articles on wikipedia, 30,588 are categorized as good articles (about 1 in 197), most of which are listed below. an additional 5,713 are listed as featured articles (about 1 in 1,060) and 3,562 as featured lists (about 1 in 1,690). because articles are only included on one list, a good article that has been promoted to featured status is removed from the good articles list. adding good and featured articles and lists together gives a total of 39,863 articles (about 1 in 151). a small plus sign inside a circle () in the top-right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is good.the process for designating an article as a good article is intentionally straightforward. any editor, preferably one who creates or contributes to an article, who believes that the article meets the good article criteria, may nominate the article for an impartial reviewer to assess. another editor may review the article after selecting it from a queue of good article nominations then evaluating it against the good article criteria. if it is accepted by the reviewer, the nominated article is added to the list of good articles below. anyone may nominate or review an article by following the instructions. similarly, anyone who believes that an article no longer meets the good article criteria may propose to delist it by following the instructions for reassessment.more good content is available at wikipedia:good topics.good article tools:project pagerelated pagesrecently listed good articles: geosynchronous orbit — magnetic resonance imaging — alfriston market cross — born under a bad sign — tkeshelashvili, nino — 2019 cricket world cup — ward, james allen — ryan, willard — harrison, gessner — esarhaddon — clarke, william francis — pohick churchrandom good article of the day: uss kickapoo (1864)read a random good article view the entire list of all good articleslist of good articles, arranged by topicagriculture, food, and drink agriculture, food, and drinklanguage and literature language and literaturemathematics mathematics and mathematiciansvideo games video gamesmiscellaneouscleanup listing for this project is available. see also the tool's wiki page and the index of wikiprojects.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#semi	wikipedia is built around/with the principle that anyone can edit it, and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors. however, in some particular circumstances, because of a specifically identified likelihood of damage resulting if editing is left open, some individual pages may need to be subject to technical restrictions (often only temporary but sometimes indefinitely) on who is permitted to modify them. the placing of such restrictions on pages is called protection.protection can be applied to or removed from pages only by wikipedia's administrators, although any user may request protection. protection can be indefinite or expire after a specified time period.the most commonly used types of protection are full protection, which means that a page can be modified only by administrators; and semi-protection, which means that a page can be modified only by users who are logged in and whose accounts have been confirmed (any account is automatically confirmed if it has existed for at least four days and has made at least ten edits). other types of protection are detailed below. protected pages are marked with a small padlock icon in the top right corner of the article page; different color padlocks represent different protection types, as shown in the images at the right. the template {{pp-protected}} is usually placed on protected pages to display the padlock. even when protected, the source code (text) of the page can still be viewed and copied by any user.placing the mouse pointer over a padlock icon produces an informational tooltip saying "this article is protected." if the padlock template's 'reason' parameter is specified, the tooltip also says why the page is protected. if the 'expiry' parameter is specified, the tooltip says for what duration the page is protected.this policy explains in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and the reasons for which protection should and should not be applied.the following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages:the following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages:any type of protection (with the exception of cascading protection) may be requested at wikipedia:requests for page protection. changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding talk page, and carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or if there is consensus for them.except in the case of office actions (see below), arbitration committee remedies, or pages in the mediawiki namespace (see below), administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary. editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at requests for unprotection. note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first. a log of protections and unprotections is available at special:log/protect.a fully protected page can be edited or moved only by administrators. the protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its talk page (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus. placing the {{edit fully protected}} template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.content disputes and edit warring may be addressed with blocks issued by uninvolved administrators while allowing normal page editing by other editors. under the protection policy, an alternative approach is available as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war. this approach may be better suited to multi-party disputes and contentious content as talk page consensus becomes a requirement for implementation of requested edits.when protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as vandalism, copyright violations, defamation, or poor-quality coverage of living people. administrators remain uninvolved when exercising their discretion, subject to this proviso, to decide whether to apply protection to the most current version of an article, or to an older, stable, or pre-edit-war version.protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus. editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version prior to the edit war and request reversion to that version. before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered involved and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions. when involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons. however, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it. the duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.if a deleted page is going through deletion review, only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page. if they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may restore the page, blank it or replace the contents with {{tempundelete}} or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing. the previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the page history.generic file names such as file:map.jpg, file:photo.jpg, and file:sound.wav are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded.administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on wikipedia which are permanently protected by the mediawiki software:in addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually permanently protected:a template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the template editors group. this protection level should be used almost exclusively on high-risk templates and modules. in cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.this is a protection level[1] that replaces full protection on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes. it should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection. it should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the template editor user right exists—the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community.editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{edit template-protected}} template if necessary to gain attention.semi-protection prevents edits from unregistered users (ip addresses), as well as edits from any account that is not autoconfirmed (at least four days old and has made at least ten edits to wikipedia) or confirmed. this level of protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or vandalism from new or unregistered users, or to prevent sockpuppets of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on biographies of living persons who have had a recent high level of media interest. an alternative to semi-protection is pending changes, which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{edit semi-protected}} template if necessary to gain attention. if the page in question and its talk page are both protected, please make your edit request at wikipedia:request for edit instead. new users may also request the confirmed user right by visiting requests for permissions.administrators may apply indefinite semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy (such as biographies of living persons, neutral point of view). semi-protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege registered users over unregistered users in (valid) content disputes.in addition, administrators may apply temporary semi-protection on pages that are:today's featured article may be semi-protected just like any other article. but since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances. for the former guideline, see wikipedia:main page featured article protection.administrators can prevent the creation of a page through the protection interface. this is useful for bad articles that have been deleted but repeatedly recreated. such protection is case-sensitive. there are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection. a list of protected titles may be found at special:protectedtitles (see also historical lists).pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the title blacklist system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for substrings and regular expressions.pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as "salted". contributors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an administrator (preferably the protecting administrator), file a request at wikipedia:requests for page protection, or use the deletion review process. to make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a draft version of the intended article when filing a request.administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection—autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed,[2] or full. due to the implementation of acperm, non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in mainspace; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.while creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user (or sockpuppets of that user, if applicable).move protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator. move protection is commonly applied to:fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.as with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring should not be considered an endorsement of the current name. when move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.all files are implicitly move-protected; only file movers and administrators can move files.upload protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator. upload protection does not protect file pages from editing. upload protection may be applied by an administrator to:as with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one file version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current file version. an exception to this rule is when files are protected due to upload vandalism.pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress vandalism and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits. pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi-protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from the view of most readers until those changes are accepted by a reviewer.when a page under pending changes protection is edited by an unregistered (ip addresses) editor or a new user, the edit is not directly visible to the majority of wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the pending changes reviewer right. when a page under pending changes protection is edited by an autoconfirmed user, the edit will be immediately visible to wikipedia readers.pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review. readers not logged in (the vast majority of readers) are shown the latest accepted version of the page; logged-in users see the latest version of the page, with all changes (reviewed or not) applied. when editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.a user who clicks "edit this page" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.pending changes may be used to protect articles against:pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred. like semi-protection, pc protection should never be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors (unregistered users) at a disadvantage. pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria. instead semi-protection should be considered.in addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to media attention) when blocking individual users is not a feasible option. as with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem. indefinite pc protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at requests for unprotection.the reviewing process is described in detail at wikipedia:reviewing pending changes.extended confirmed protection, also known as 30/500 protection, allows edits only by editors with the extended confirmed user access level, granted automatically to registered users with at least 30 days tenure and 500 edits.where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective, administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption (such as vandalism, abusive sockpuppetry, edit wars, etc.) on any topic. extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by arbitration committee 30/500 rulings. extended confirmed protection may be applied by an administrator at their discretion when creation-protecting a page.[2]until august 12, 2016,[3] 30/500 protection applied only in topic areas determined by the arbitration committee, which authorized its use on articles reasonably construed as belonging to the arab–israeli conflict;[4] as an arbitration enforcement tool by motion or remedy;[5] or as a result of community consensus.[6] in february 2019, the community authorized uninvolved administrators to place pages reasonably construed as belonging to the india–pakistan conflict under extended confirmed protection as part of a general sanctions regime.[7] as of september 23, 2016, a bot posts a notification in a subsection of an when this protection level is used.[8] a full list of the 1943 pages under 30/500 protection can be found here.users can request edits to an extended confirmed-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{edit extended-protected}} template if necessary to gain attention.as outlined in meta:office actions#use of advanced rights by foundation staff, pages may be protected by wikimedia foundation staff in response to issues such as copyright infringement or libel. such actions override community consensus. administrators should not edit or unprotect such pages without permission from wikimedia foundation staff.cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection automatically to any page that is transcluded onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly. this includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the english wikipedia. files stored on commons are not protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and must be temporarily uploaded to the english wikipedia or protected at commons, either manually or through cascading protection there. when operational, krinklebot cascade-protects commons files transcluded at wikipedia:main page/tomorrow, wikipedia:main page/commons media protection and main page. as the bot's response time varies, media should not be transcluded on the main page (or its constituent templates) until after it has been protected. (this is particularly relevant to template:in the news, for which upcoming images are not queued at wikipedia:main page/tomorrow.) cascading protection:the list of cascading-protected pages can be found at wikipedia:cascade-protected items. requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at wikipedia talk:cascade-protected items as an edit request.superprotect was a level of protection, allowing editing only by wikimedia foundation employees who are in the staff global group. it was implemented on august 10, 2014 and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the media viewer on the german wikipedia's primary site javascript, common.js. it was never used on the english wikipedia. on november 5, 2015, the wmf decided to remove superprotect from all wikimedia wikis.cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after users noticed that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level 2 required edits by all users who are not pending changes reviewers to be reviewed. following a community discussion, level 2 was retired from the english wikipedia in january 2017. it was suggested then that "pending changes level 1" be referred to in the future as simply "pending changes".[9]modifications to a protected page can be proposed on its talk page (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus. placing the {{edit protected}} template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.user talk pages are rarely protected, and are semi-protected for short durations only in the most severe cases of vandalism from ip users. users whose talk pages are semi-protected should have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from non-autoconfirmed users.a user's request to have his or her own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process. it also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.in extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the {{unblock}} template, re-blocking the user without talk page access should be preferred over protection. if the user has been indefinitely blocked from editing the talk page, they should be informed of off-wiki ways to appeal their block, such as the utrs tool interface or as a last recourse,  the arbitration committee.when required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with wikipedia:sockpuppetry; their pages are not normally protected.base user pages (for example, the page user:example, and not user:example/subpage or user talk:example) are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed and ip users. an exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered user attempting to edit their own user page. ip and unconfirmed editors are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a registered user. this protection is enforced by a filter.[10] users may opt-out of this protection by placing {{unlocked userpage}} anywhere on their own page.user pages and subpages may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists—pages in user space should not be automatically or pre-emptively protected.[11] requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels (such as template protection) may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.when a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a ".css" subpage (ex. user:example/userpage.css), copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting {{user:example/userpage.css}} on their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page. because user space pages that end in ".css", ".js", and ".json" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs (and interface administrators), this will protect your user page from further vandalism.in the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page (but not the user talk page) should be fully protected.highly visible templates, which are used on an extremely large number of pages or substituted with great frequency, are often semi- or template-protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, etc.protected templates should normally have the {{documentation}} template. it loads the unprotected /doc page, so that non-admins and ip-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links. it also automatically adds {{pp-template}} to protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected. only manually add {{pp-template}} to protected templates that don't use {{documentation}} (mostly the flag templates).cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside <includeonly> tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but will protect the template's documentation subpage. instead, consider any of the following:note: all editnotice templates (except those in userspace) are already protected via mediawiki:titleblacklist. they can be edited by admins, template editors and page movers only.sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with wiki syntax. most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours, although they are frequently overwritten by other testing users. the wikipedia:sandbox is cleaned every hour. those who use sandboxes for malicious purposes, or to violate policies such as no personal attacks, civility, or copyrights, should instead be warned and/or blocked.the following templates may be added at the very top of a page to indicate that it is protected:on redirect pages, use the {{redirect category shell}} template, which automatically categorizes by protection level, below the redirect line. a protection template may also be added below the redirect line, but it will serve only to categorize the page, as it will not be visible on the page, and it will have to be manually removed when protection is removed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan	christopher edward nolan, cbe (/ˈnoʊlən/; born 30 july 1970) is a british-american filmmaker, who is known for making personal, distinctive films within the hollywood mainstream. his ten films have grossed over us$4.7 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 34 oscar nominations and ten wins.born and raised in london, nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. after studying english literature at university college london, he made his feature debut with following (1998). nolan gained international recognition with his second film, memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the academy award for best original screenplay. he transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with the dark knight trilogy (2005–2012), the prestige (2006), and inception (2010), which received eight oscar nominations, including for best picture and best original screenplay. this was followed by interstellar (2014), dunkirk (2017), which earned him academy award nominations for best picture and best director, and the upcoming tenet (2020).nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. his work is permeated by unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. he has co-written several of his films with his brother jonathan, and runs the production company syncopy inc. with his wife emma thomas.nolan has received many awards and honours. time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015; in 2019, he was appointed commander of the order of the british empire for his services to film. in addition to his filmmaking, nolan is an advocate for film preservation and the analog medium.nolan was born in westminster, london, and grew up in highgate.[1][2] his father, brendan james nolan, was a british advertising executive who worked as a creative director.[3] his mother, christina (née jensen), was an american flight attendant who would later work as an english teacher.[4][5][6] nolan's childhood was split between london and evanston, illinois, and he has both british and us citizenship.[7][8][9][10] he has an older brother, matthew francis nolan, a convicted criminal,[11] and a younger brother, jonathan.[12] growing up, nolan was particularly influenced by the work of ridley scott, and the science fiction films 2001: a space odyssey (1968) and star wars (1977).[13][14] he began making films at age seven, borrowing his father's super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[15][16] these films included a stop motion animation homage to star wars called space wars. he cast his brother jonathan and built sets from "clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls."[17] his uncle, who worked at nasa building guidance systems for the apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: "i re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice," nolan later remarked.[5][18][19] from the age of eleven, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.[12] in his teenage years, nolan started making films with adrien and roko belic. nolan and roko co–directed the surreal 8 mm tarantella (1989), which was shown on image union, an independent film and video showcase on the public broadcasting service.[note 1][23]nolan was educated at haileybury and imperial service college, an independent school in hertford heath, hertfordshire, and later read english literature at university college london (ucl). opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued "a degree in something unrelated ... because it gives a different take on things."[25] he chose ucl specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a steenbeck editing suite and 16 mm film cameras.[26] nolan was president of the union's film society,[26] and with emma thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened 35 mm feature films during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers.[27]after earning his bachelor's degree in english literature in 1993, nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator, and director of corporate videos and industrial films.[26][6][28] in 1995, he began work on the short film larceny, which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew.[29][30] funded by nolan and shot with the society's equipment, it appeared at the cambridge film festival in 1996 and is considered one of ucl's best shorts.[31] he filmed a third short, doodlebug (1997), about a man chasing an insect around a flat with a shoe, only to discover when killing it that it is a miniature of himself.[32] nolan had written the script while a student at ucl.[33] during this period in his career, nolan had little or no success getting his projects off the ground; he later recalled the "stack of rejection letters" that greeted his early forays into making films, adding "there's a very limited pool of finance in the uk. to be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place ... never had any support whatsoever from the british film industry."[34]in 1998, nolan released his first feature, following. he wrote, directed, photographed and edited the film, which depicts an unemployed young writer (jeremy theobald) who trails strangers through london, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. the film was inspired by nolan's experience of living in london and having his apartment burgled: "there is an interesting connection between a stranger going through your possessions and the concept of following people at random through a crowd – both take you beyond the boundaries of ordinary social relations".[35] co-produced by nolan with emma thomas and jeremy theobald,[36] it was funded by him and made on a modest budget of £3,000.[37][38] most of the cast and crew were nolan's friends, and shooting took place on weekends over the course of a year.[38]  to conserve film stock, each scene in the film was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit.[39][40] following won several awards during its festival run[41][42] and was well received by critics; the new yorker wrote that it "echoed hitchcock classics", but was "leaner and meaner".[15] janet maslin of the new york times was impressed with its "spare look" and agile hand-held camerawork, saying, "as a result, the actors convincingly carry off the before, during and after modes that the film eventually, and artfully, weaves together."[43] on 11 december 2012 it was released on dvd and blu-ray as part of the criterion collection.[44]—nolan (in 2012) on the jump from his first film to his second.[38]following's success led to nolan being afforded the opportunity to make memento (2000), which became his breakthrough film. the synopsis came from his brother jonathan, who pitched the idea  to nolan during a road trip about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. jonathan worked the idea into a short story, "memento mori" (2001), while nolan developed it into a screenplay that told the story in reverse. aaron ryder, an executive for newmarket films, said it was "perhaps the most innovative script i had ever seen".[45] the film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5 million, with guy pearce and carrie-anne moss in the starring roles.[46] memento premiered at the venice international film festival in september 2000 to critical acclaim.[47] joe morgenstern of the wall street journal wrote in his review, "i can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time."[48] basil smith, in the book the philosophy of neo-noir, draws a comparison with john locke's an essay concerning human understanding, which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities, a theme that nolan explores in the film.[49] the film was a box-office success[50] and received a number of accolades, including academy award and golden globe award nominations for its screenplay, independent spirit awards for best director and best screenplay, and a directors guild of america (dga) award nomination.[51][52] memento was considered by numerous critics to be one of the best films of the 2000s.[53] in 2017, the film was selected by the library of congress for preservation in the united states national film registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[54]impressed by his work on memento, steven soderbergh recruited nolan to direct the psychological thriller insomnia (2002), starring academy award winners al pacino, robin williams, and hilary swank.[55] warner bros. initially wanted a more seasoned director, but soderbergh and his section eight productions fought for nolan, as well as his choice of cinematographer (wally pfister) and editor (dody dorn).[56] with a $46 million budget, it was described as "a much more conventional hollywood film than anything [nolan had] done before".[55] a remake of the 1997 norwegian film of the same name, insomnia is about two los angeles detectives sent to a northern alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager. it received positive reviews from critics and performed well at the box office, earning $113 million worldwide.[57][58] film critic roger ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt, stating that "unlike most remakes, the nolan insomnia is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play."[59] erik skjoldbjærg, the director of the original film, was satisfied with nolan's version, calling it a "well crafted, smart film ... with a really good director handling it".[60] richard schickel of time deemed insomnia a "worthy successor" to memento, and "a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery".[61]after insomnia, nolan planned a howard hughes biographical film starring jim carrey. he wrote a screenplay, which he said was "the best script i've ever written", but when he learned that martin scorsese was making a hughes biopic (2004's the aviator), he reluctantly tabled his script and moved on to other projects.[62][63] after turning down an offer to direct the historical epic troy (2004),[64] nolan worked on adapting ruth rendell's crime novel the keys to the street into a screenplay that he planned to direct for fox searchlight pictures, but eventually left the project, citing the similarities to his previous films.[65] nolan was also adapting a film version of the prisoner,[66] but later dropped out of the project.[67]in early 2003 nolan approached warner bros. with the idea of making a new batman film.[68] fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a "relatable" world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy.[69] filming took place in 2004, and nolan relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects, with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity.[68] batman begins, the biggest project nolan had undertaken to that point,[69] premiered in june 2005 to critical acclaim and commercial success.[70] starring christian bale in the title role, along with michael caine, gary oldman, morgan freeman, and liam neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films that rebooted (or retold) backstories.[71][72] praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance,[73] kyle smith of the new york post called it "a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. it wipes the smirk off the face of the superhero movie."[74] batman begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the united states and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide.[75] it was nominated for the academy award for best cinematography and three bafta awards.[76][77] on the film's 10th anniversary, forbes published an article describing its lasting influence: "reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. the phrase "dark and gritty" likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well."[78]before returning to the batman franchise for a sequel, nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the prestige (2006), an adaptation of the christopher priest novel about two rival 19th-century magicians.[79] the screenplay was the result of an intermittent, five-year collaboration between him and his brother jonathan, who had begun writing it already in 2001.[80] nolan initially intended to make the film as early as 2003, but had postponed the project after agreeing to make batman begins.[81] starring hugh jackman and christian bale in the lead roles, the prestige received critical acclaim and earned over $109 million worldwide.[82][83] roger ebert described it as "quite a movie – atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic",[84] and kenneth turan of the los angeles times called it an "ambitious, unnerving melodrama".[85] philip french wrote in his review for the guardian: "in addition to the intellectual or philosophical excitement it engenders, the prestige is gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny."[86] the prestige also received academy award nominations for best cinematography and best art direction.[87]in 2006, nolan announced that the follow-up to batman begins would be called the dark knight.[88] approaching the sequel, nolan wanted to expand on the noirish quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on "the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals".[89] released in july 2008 to great critical acclaim, the dark knight has been cited as one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever made.[53][90][91] manohla dargis of the new york times found the film to be of higher artistic merit than many hollywood blockbusters: "pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any hollywood movie of its comic-book kind."[92] ebert expressed a similar point of view, describing it as a "haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy."[93] the dark knight set a number of box-office records during its theatrical run,[94] earning $534,858,444 in north america and $469,700,000 abroad, for a worldwide total of $1,004,558,444.[95] at the 81st academy awards, the film was nominated for eight oscars, winning two: the academy award for best sound editing and a posthumous academy award for best supporting actor for heath ledger.[96] nolan received many awards and nominations for his work on the film.[51] in 2018, bilge ebiri of the village voice wrote, "its politics have been discussed ad infinitum. its stylistic influence has become ubiquitous, then passé, then somehow aspirational ... the dark knight is perhaps the most powerful exploration of guilt the modern american blockbuster has given us."[97]after the dark knight's success, warner bros. signed nolan to direct inception (2010). nolan also wrote and co-produced the film, described as "a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind".[98] starring a large ensemble cast led by leonardo dicaprio, the film became a critical and commercial success upon its release in july 2010.[99] richard roeper of the chicago sun-times awarded the film a perfect score of "a+" and called it "one of the best movies of the [21st] century".[100] mark kermode named it the best film of 2010, stating "inception is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing."[101][102] the film ended up grossing over $820 million worldwide[103] and was nominated for eight academy awards, including best picture and best original screenplay; it won the award for best cinematography, best sound mixing, best sound editing and best visual effects.[104] nolan was also nominated for bafta and golden globe awards, among other accolades.[51]in 2012, nolan directed his third and final batman film, the dark knight rises, with christian bale reprising the title role. although nolan was initially hesitant about returning to the series, he agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and david s. goyer that he felt would end the series on a high note.[105][106] the film was released in july 2012 to positive reviews; andrew o'hehir of salon called it "arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen", further describing the work as "auteurist spectacle on a scale never before possible and never before attempted".[107][108] christy lemire of the associated press wrote in her review that nolan concluded his trilogy in a "typically spectacular, ambitious fashion", but disliked the "overloaded" story and excessive grimness.[109] like its predecessor, the film was a box office success, becoming the thirteenth film to reach the billion-dollar mark.[110] during a midnight showing of the film at the century 16 cinema in aurora, colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.[111] nolan released a statement to the press expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a senseless tragedy.[112]during story discussions for the dark knight rises in 2010, goyer told nolan of his idea to present superman in a modern context.[113] impressed with goyer's first contact concept, nolan pitched the idea for man of steel (2013) to warner bros, who hired nolan to produce and zack snyder to direct.[114][113] starring henry cavill, amy adams, kevin costner, russell crowe, and michael shannon, man of steel grossed more than $660 million at the worldwide box office, but received a divided critical reaction.[115] despite the mixed reviews, nolan was thoroughly impressed by snyder's work, saying that the director "knocked it out of the park", and that he believed the film would have the same potential to excite audiences as when he himself saw the christopher reeve version in 1978.[116]nolan next directed, wrote, and produced the science-fiction film interstellar (2014). the first drafts of the script were written by jonathan nolan, and it was originally to be directed by steven spielberg.[117] based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist kip thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.[118] interstellar starred matthew mcconaughey, anne hathaway, jessica chastain, bill irwin, michael caine, and ellen burstyn, and was nolan's first collaboration with cinematographer hoyte van hoytema. interstellar was released in november 2014 to largely positive reviews and strong box office results, grossing over $670 million worldwide.[119][120][121] a. o. scott wrote, in his review for the new york times, "interstellar, full of visual dazzle, thematic ambition ... is a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret."[122] documentary filmmaker toni myers said of the film, "i loved it because it tackled the most difficult part of human exploration, which is that it's a multi-generational journey. it was a real work of art."[123] interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two scientific papers[124] and the american journal of physics calling for it to be shown in school science lessons.[125][126] it was named one of the best films of the year by the american film institute (afi).[127] at the 87th academy awards, the film won best visual effects and received four other nominations – best original score, best sound mixing, best sound editing and best production design.[128] in 2014, nolan and emma thomas also served as executive producers on transcendence (2014), the directorial debut of nolan's longtime cinematographer wally pfister.[129] the film was released to mostly unfavorable reviews and disappointing box office results.[130]in the mid-2010s, nolan took part in several ventures for film preservation and distribution of the films of lesser-known filmmakers. his production company, syncopy, formed a joint venture with zeitgeist films to release blu-ray editions of zeitgeist's prestige titles.[131] as part of the blu-ray release of the animation films of the brothers quay, nolan directed the documentary short quay (2015). he also initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the quays' in absentia, the comb, and street of crocodiles. the program and nolan's short received critical acclaim, with indiewire writing in their review that the brothers "will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of nolan, and for that the quay brothers in 35mm will always be one of latter's most important contributions to cinema".[132][133] an advocate for the survival of the analogue medium, nolan and visual artist tacita dean invited representatives from leading american film archives, laboratories, and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled reframing the future of film at the getty museum in march 2015.[134][135] subsequent events were held at tate modern in london, museo tamayo in mexico city, and tata theatre in mumbai.[136] in 2015, nolan also joined the board of directors of the film foundation, a us-based non-profitable organisation dedicated to film preservation,[137] and was appointed, along with martin scorsese, by the library of congress to serve on the national film preservation board (nfpb) as dga representatives.[138]after serving as an executive producer alongside thomas on zack snyder's batman v superman: dawn of justice (2016) and justice league (2017), the sequels to man of steel,[139][140] nolan returned to directing with dunkirk (2017). based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with thomas, the story is set amid world war ii and the evacuation of allied soldiers from the beaches of dunkirk, france, in 1940. describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, nolan wanted to make a "sensory, almost experimental movie" with minimal dialogue.[141] he said he waited to make dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a british film, but with an american budget.[142] before filming, nolan sought advice from spielberg, who later said in an interview with variety, "knowing and respecting that chris [nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as i did on ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama."[143] starring fionn whitehead, jack lowden, aneurin barnard, harry styles, tom hardy, mark rylance, cillian murphy, and kenneth branagh,[144] dunkirk was released in theatres in july 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results.[145][146][147] it grossed over $525 million worldwide, which made it the highest-grossing world war ii film of all time.[148] in his review, mick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle wrote: "it's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. there are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. dunkirk is that kind of movie."[149] the film received many accolades, including nolan's first oscar nomination for best director.[150]in the months following the 2017–18 oscar season, nolan began supervising a new 70mm print of stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey (1968), made from the original camera negative; he presented it at the 2018 cannes film festival[151][152] while in cannes, the director also held a two-hour masterclass at the palais des festivals. usa today observed that he was greeted "like a rock star", and with a prolonged standing ovation.[153] nolan served as executive producer on the doll's breath (2019), an animated short directed by the quay brothers. the film was inspired by felisberto hernández's las hortensias, and was commissioned by nolan "on the condition that it was shot on 35mm film."[154]nolan's eleventh feature, tenet, is scheduled to be released by warner bros. on 17 july 2020.[155] nolan wrote the screenplay and is producing with emma thomas. the film stars john david washington, robert pattinson, elizabeth debicki, aaron taylor-johnson, dimple kapadia, clémence poésy, kenneth branagh and michael caine.[156]nolan's films are often grounded in existential and epistemological themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory, and identity.[157][158][159] his work is characterised by unconventional narrative structures, richly textured imagery, and evocative use of music and sound.[5][160] film theorist david bordwell opined that nolan has been able to blend his "experimental impulses" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, further describing his oeuvre as, "experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting."[161] nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential.[162] indiewire said the director has "kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive" in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become "a largely computer-generated art form."[162]nolan is married to emma thomas, whom he met at university college london when he was 19.[12][27] she has worked as a producer on all of his films, and together they founded the production company syncopy inc.[163] the couple have four children and reside in los angeles, california.[164][165] protective of his privacy, he rarely discusses his personal life in interviews.[166] however, he has publicly shared some of his sociopolitical concerns for the future, such as the current conditions of nuclear weapons and environmental issues that he says need to be addressed.[167] he has also expressed an admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied "in every aspect of our civilization."[168] he is red-green colour blind.[169]nolan prefers not to use a mobile phone or an email address,[170] saying, "it's not that i'm a luddite and don't like technology; i've just never been interested ... when i moved to los angeles in 1997, nobody really had cell phones, and i just never went down that path."[171] he also prohibits use of phones on set.[172]having made some of the most influential and popular films of his time,[173][174][175][176] nolan's work has been as "intensely embraced, analyzed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics".[166][177][178] several of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades,[179][180][181][182][183] and according to the wall street journal, his "ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry."[184] in 2016, memento, the dark knight, and inception appeared in bbc's 100 greatest films of the 21st century list.[185] in the following year, five of his (then nine) films featured in empire magazine's poll of the 100 greatest movies.[186] film scholar david bordwell observed that nolan is "considered one of the most accom­plished living filmmakers," citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim, and popularity among cinemagoers.[161][187]geoff andrew of the british film institute and sight & sound magazine, called nolan "a persuasively inventive storyteller", singling him out as one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the hollywood mainstream. he also pointed out that nolan's films are as notable for their "considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair" as for their "brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions".[188][189] in 2008, film critic philip french deemed nolan "the first major talent to emerge this [21st] century",[190] while forbes called him "one of the most successful and acclaimed filmmakers of our time" in 2015.[191] the observer described nolan as a "skilful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of nicolas roeg or alain resnais".[192] mark cousins applauded the director for embracing big ideas, "hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas — but not christopher nolan".[193] scott foundas of variety declared nolan "the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation",[194] while justin chang of the los angeles times called him "the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae."[195]the filmmaker has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and some have cited his work as influencing their own.[196][197][198][199][200][201] rupert wyatt said in an interview that he thinks of nolan as a "trailblazer ... he is to be hugely admired as a master filmmaker, but also someone who has given others behind him a stick to beat back the naysayers who never thought a modern mass audience would be willing to embrace story and character as much as spectacle".[202] kenneth branagh called nolan's approach to large-scale filmmaking "unique in modern cinema", adding "regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. i think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera."[203] michael mann complimented nolan for his "singular vision" and called him "a complete auteur".[204] nicolas roeg said of nolan, "[his] films have a magic to them ... people talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work."[204] martin scorsese identified nolan as a filmmaker creating "beautifully made films on a big scale",[205] and luca guadagnino called him "one of the ultimate auteurs."[206] damien chazelle said of nolan, "this is a filmmaker who has managed, time and again, to make the most seemingly impersonal projects — superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders — feel deeply personal".[207]olivier assayas said he admired nolan for "making movies that are really unlike anything else. the way i see it, he has a really authentic voice."[208] discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, steven spielberg referred to nolan's dark knight series as an example of both;[209] he has described memento and inception as "masterworks".[210] denis villeneuve said of nolan, "[he] is a very impressive filmmaker, because he is able to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope ... to bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now — it's very rare. every movie that he comes out with, i have more admiration for his work."[211] film critic mark kermode complimented the director for bringing "the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking" to hollywood blockbusters, calling him "living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable".[212]in 2013 a survey of seventeen film academics showed that nolan was among the most studied directors in britain.[213] his work has also been recognised as an influence on video games.[214][215] video game designer hideo kojima compared dunkirk to his own work, saying "its approach to technology in movie making and refusal to rely on defeating one's enemies as a portrayal of war, reminds me in many ways of my work on metal gear and where i hope to see my next game go".[216] nolan appeared in time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2015 and in the forbes celebrity 100 in 2011 and 2013.[217][218]nolan was named an honorary fellow of ucl in 2006, and conferred an honorary doctorate in literature (dlit) in 2017.[219][220] in 2012, he became the youngest director to receive a hand-and-footprint ceremony at grauman's chinese theatre in los angeles.[221] nolan was appointed commander of the order of the british empire (cbe) in the 2019 new year honours for his services to film.[222]directed features:

angeles, california,[1] the only child of irmelin (née indenbirken), a legal secretary, and george dicaprio, an underground comix writer, publisher, and distributor of comic books.[2] dicaprio's father is of italian and german descent, and the actor is conversant in italian.[3][4] dicaprio's maternal grandfather, wilhelm indenbirken, was german,[5] and his maternal grandmother, helene indenbirken, was a russian-born german citizen.[6][7] in an interview in russia, dicaprio referred to himself as "half-russian" and said that two of his late grandparents were russian.[6] dicaprio's parents met while attending college and moved to los angeles after graduating.[8]dicaprio was named leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a leonardo da vinci painting in the uffizi museum in florence, italy, when he first kicked.[9] his parents separated when he was a year old; they initially agreed to live next door to each other so as not to deprive dicaprio of his father's presence in his life.[10][11] however, dicaprio and his mother later moved around to multiple los angeles neighborhoods, such as echo park and los feliz, while the latter worked several jobs.[8] he attended seeds elementary school and later went to john marshall high school a few blocks away after attending the los angeles center for enriched studies for four years.[12] dicaprio has said he hated public school, and often asked his mother to take him to auditions instead to improve their financial situation.[13] he dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (ged).[14]dicaprio has said his career choice as a child was to become a marine biologist or an actor, but he eventually favored the latter, as he was fond of impersonating characters and imitating people.[15] when he was two, he went on stage at a performance festival and danced spontaneously; the cheerful response from the crowd started his interest in performing.[16] when his older stepbrother earned $50,000 for a television commercial, dicaprio, fascinated with this, decided to become an actor.[17] in 1979, dicaprio was removed, at the age of five, from the set of the children's television series romper room for being disruptive.[18][19] he began appearing in several commercials at age 14 for matchbox cars by mattel, which he considered

of his career, dicaprio had difficulty finding an agent. one agent suggested he change his name to lenny williams to appeal to the american audience, which he refused.[24][25] he remained jobless for a year and a half even after 100 auditions. disillusioned at this, he initially decided to quit acting, but his father encouraged him not to give up.[24] by the early 1990s, he began acting regularly on television, starting with a role in the pilot of the outsiders (1990) and one episode of the soap opera santa barbara (1990), in which he played the young mason capwell.[26] dicaprio got a break that year when he was cast in parenthood, a series based on a successful comedy film of same name. before being cast in the role of garry buckman, a troubled teenager, he analyzed joaquin phoenix's performance in the original film.[27] his work that year earned him two nominations at the 12th youth in film awards—best young actor in a daytime series for santa barbara and best young actor starring in a new television series for parenthood.[28] dicaprio was also a celebrity contestant on the children's game show fun house, on which he performed several stunts, including catching the fish inside a small pool using only his teeth.[29][30]in 1991, dicaprio played an un-credited role in one episode of roseanne.[31] he made his film debut later that year as the stepson of an evil landlord in the low-budget horror direct-to-video film critters 3, a role he described as "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair."[32] dicaprio prefers not to remember his role in critters 3, which he describes as "possibly one of the worst films of all time. i guess it was a good example to look back and make sure it doesn't happen again."[33] later that year, he became a recurring cast member on the sitcom growing pains, playing luke brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the seaver family.[34] costar joanna kerns recalls dicaprio being "especially intelligent and disarming for his age" but also mischievous on set.[35] the teenage dicaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to the teenage female audiences, but when the show's ratings did not improve, dicaprio left it.[34] he was nominated for a young artist award for best young actor co-starring in a television series.[36]in 1992, dicaprio played a supporting role in the first installment of the poison ivy film series,[37] and was handpicked by robert de niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in michael caton-jones's this boy's life. he played opposite de niro, who was acting as his stepfather, and ellen barkin as his mother.[18][38] caton-jones has said dicaprio did not know how to behave on set; he applied a strict mentoring style that he said resulted in improvements in dicaprio's behavior.[35] bilge ebiri of rolling stone found it "an evocative, touching little movie, defined by the powerful bond between barkin and dicaprio", praising his complex growth from "a wide-eyed son to a rebellious greaser to an independent, sensitive young man".[37]in 1993, dicaprio costarred as the mentally handicapped brother of johnny depp's character in what's eating gilbert grape, a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional iowa family. director lasse hallström admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor, but cast dicaprio when he contacted caton-jones and he had emerged as "the most observant actor" among all who auditioned.[35][32] the film became a critical success,[39] earning dicaprio a national board of review award for best supporting actor and nominations for an academy award and a golden globe award.[40] "the film's real show-stopping turn comes from mr. dicaprio", wrote the new york times critic janet maslin, "who makes arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. the performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end."[41] caryn james, also writing for the new york times, said of his performances in this boy's life and what's eating gilbert grape: "he made the raw, emotional neediness of those boys completely natural and powerful."[42]dicaprio's first effort of 1995 was in sam raimi's western film the quick and the dead. sony pictures was dubious over dicaprio's casting, and as a result, costar sharon stone paid his salary herself.[43] the film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing $18.5 million in the us, and received mixed reviews from critics.[44] dicaprio's next film in 1995 was the basketball diaries, a biopic, in which he played a teenage jim carroll as a drug-addicted high school basketball player and writer.[45] dicaprio next starred alongside david thewlis in agnieszka holland's erotic drama total eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between arthur rimbaud (dicaprio) and paul verlaine (thewlis). he replaced river phoenix, who died before filming began.[10] the film grossed only about $340,000 against its €6-million budget,[46] but has been included in the catalogue of warner archive collection.[47]in 1996, dicaprio appeared opposite claire danes in baz luhrmann's film romeo + juliet, an abridged modernization of william shakespeare's romantic tragedy of same name, which retained the original shakespearean dialogue. the project grossed $147 million worldwide, and earned dicaprio a silver bear for best actor at the 1997 berlin international film festival.[48][49] later that year, dicaprio starred in marvin's room, a family drama revolving around two sisters, played by meryl streep and diane keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. dicaprio portrayed hank, streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum.[50] on his performance, lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly commented: "the deeply gifted dicaprio [...] keeps right up with these older pros [keaton and streep]. the three are so full-bodied and so powerfully affecting that you're carried along on the pleasure of being in the presence of their extraordinary talent."[51] reviewing his works of his early career, david thomson of the guardian called dicaprio "a revelation" in what's eating gilbert grape, "very moving" in this boy's life, "suitably desperate" in the basketball diaries and "a vital spark" in romeo + juliet.[52]dicaprio refused an offer to do the film boogie nights (1997) to star alongside kate winslet in james cameron's titanic (1997) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard rms titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage.[53] dicaprio initially had doubts about playing the role, but was eventually encouraged to pursue the part by cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability.[54] with a production budget of more than $200 million, the film was the most expensive ever made and was shot at rosarito beach where a replica of the ship was created.[55] against expectations, titanic went on to become the highest-grossing film to that point, eventually grossing more than $2.1 billion in box-office receipts worldwide,[a] and transformed dicaprio into a superstar, resulting in intense adoration among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as "leo-mania".[58][59] the film won 11 academy awards—the most for any film—including best picture, but dicaprio's failure to gain a nomination led to a protest against the academy of motion picture arts and sciences by more than 200 fans.[60][61] he was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a golden globe award for best actor.[62]dicaprio stated in 2000: "i have no connection with me during that whole titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] i'll never reach that state of popularity again, and i don't expect to. it's not something i'm going to try to achieve either."[63] john hiscock of the daily telegraph compared dicaprio's popularity during that time to that of the beatles' in the 1960s.[58] bilge ebiri called his role in the film his best in 2015, writing that dicaprio and winslet "infuse their earnest back-and-forth with so much genuine emotion that it's hard not to get swept up in their doomed love affair".[37]dicaprio played a self-mocking role in a small appearance in woody allen's caustic satire of the fame industry, celebrity (1998) whom bilge ebiri labelled "the best thing in the film".[64][37] that year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous king louis xiv and his secret, sympathetic twin brother philippe in randall wallace's the man in the iron mask, based on the same-titled 1939 film. the film received mixed to negative response,[65] but became a box office success, grossing $180 million internationally.[66] entertainment weekly critic owen gleiberman wrote that dicaprio did not look old enough to play the part, but praised him as "a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel".[67] dicaprio was awarded a golden raspberry award for worst screen couple for both incarnations the following year.[68]dicaprio was cast in american psycho (2000) in 1998 for a reported salary of $20 million, but left the project soon after when he failed to agree with oliver stone on the film's direction and took the lead role in the beach instead.[69] the latter, an adaption of alex garland's 1996 novel of the same name, saw him play an american backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the gulf of thailand. budgeted at $50 million, the film earned about three times more at the box office,[70] but was negatively reviewed by critics, and earned him a nomination for the golden raspberry award for worst actor.[71][72] todd mccarthy of variety noted that his character is "too much the american everyman" and "dicaprio, while perfectly watchable," failed to give the character the unique marks to make him dimensional.[73]in the mid 1990s, dicaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called don's plum as a favor to aspiring director r. d. robb.[18] when robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, dicaprio and costar tobey maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom.[18] the film eventually premiered at the 2001 berlin international film festival, where it was well received by critics.[74]dicaprio rejected the role of anakin skywalker in star wars: episode ii – attack of the clones (2002).[75] his first film that year was the biographical crime drama film catch me if you can, based on the life of frank abagnale jr., who before his 19th birthday committed check fraud to make millions in the 1960s. directed by steven spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in 52 days, making it "the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making" dicaprio had experienced yet.[76] the film received favorable reviews and was an international success, becoming dicaprio's highest-grossing release since titanic with a total of $351 million worldwide.[77] roger ebert praised his performance, and found his departure from dark and troubled characters "breezy and charming",[78] while two entertainment weekly critics in 2018 called it dicaprio's best role, labeling him "delightfully persuasive, deceptive, flirtatious, and sometimes tragic—and we dare you to find a better role, if you can".[79] dicaprio received his third golden globe nomination for his work in the film.[80]also in 2002, dicaprio appeared in martin scorsese's gangs of new york, a historical drama set in the mid-19th century in the five points district of new york city. director scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until dicaprio became interested in playing protagonist amsterdam vallon, a young leader of an irish-american street gang, and thus miramax films got involved with financing the project.[81] nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director disagreements, resulting in an eight-month shoot and, at $103 million, the most expensive film scorsese had ever made.[81] gangs of new york earned a total of $193 million worldwide and received mostly positive reviews.[82][83] dicaprio's performance, although well-received, was overshadowed by that of daniel day-lewis' according to many critics.[79][84]in 2004, dicaprio founded the production company appian way productions, taking its name from the italian road of the same name.[26] he was interested in finding "out of the box" material from an actor's perspective and developing it in a way that stayed true to its original source. he said, "a lot of times, i'd gone through the process of getting a great book or finding a great story, and then too many people get their hands on it and it turns into something entirely different. it is very difficult to reverse that process."[85] dicaprio's first producing task was as an executive producer in niels mueller' the assassination of richard nixon, starring sean penn as samuel byck, who attempted to assassinate us president richard nixon in 1974.[86] it was screened in the un certain regard section at the 2004 cannes film festival.[87] dicaprio and scorsese reunited for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive american film director and aviation pioneer howard hughes in the aviator (2004), which dicaprio also co-produced under appian way. dicaprio initially developed the project with michael mann, who decided against directing it after working on biopics the insider (1999) and ali (2001).[84] dicaprio eventually pitched john logan's script to scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. the aviator became a critical and financial success.[88] simond braund of empire wrote dicaprio stood out in scenes depicting hughes' paranoia and obsession, "dispelling fears that he hasn't the weight to carry such a complex, forceful role".[89] he received a golden globe award for best actor and his first academy award for best actor nomination.[90]in 2006, dicaprio starred in the crime film the departed and the political war thriller blood diamond. in scorsese's the departed dicaprio played the role of billy costigan, a state trooper working undercover in the irish mob in boston, someone he characterizes as in a "constant, 24-hour panic attack". dicaprio especially liked the experience of working with costar jack nicholson, describing a scene with him as "one of the most memorable moments" of his life as an actor.[91] in preparation, dicaprio visited boston to interact with people associated with the irish mob and gained 15 pounds (6.8 kg) of muscle.[92] highly anticipated, the film was released to positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006.[93] peter travers of rolling stone praised dicaprio's and costar matt damon's "explosive, emotionally complex performances", but felt that nicholson overshadowed the two.[94] budgeted at $90 million, the film grossed $291 million and emerged as dicaprio and scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date.[95]in blood diamond, dicaprio starred as a diamond smuggler from rhodesia who is involved in the sierra leone civil war. while filming, he worked with 24 orphaned children from the sos children's village in maputo, mozambique, and said he was touched by his interactions with them.[96] to prepare, he spent six months in africa, learned about camouflage from people in south african military and interviewed and recorded people in the country to improve his south african accent.[97] the film received generally favorable reviews,[98] and dicaprio was praised for the authenticity of his south african accent, known as difficult to imitate.[99] claudia puig of the usa today called it "the first time the boyish actor has truly seemed like a man on film" and ann hornaday of the washington post positively noted his growth as an actor since the departed.[100][101] both the golden globes and the screen actors guild nominated dicaprio in the best actor category for each of his 2006 features, and dicaprio earned his third academy award nomination for blood diamond.[102] his performance in the departed also earned him a satellite award for best supporting actor.[103]in 2007, dicaprio produced the comedy drama gardener of eden (2007), which, according to the hollywood reporter's frank scheck, "lack[ed] the necessary dramatic urgency or black humor to connect with audiences".[104] shortly after, he created, produced, co-wrote and narrated the 11th hour, a documentary about people's relationship to nature and global warming. it won the earthwatch environmental film award through the national geographic channel in march 2008.[105] dicaprio was also a creator and an executive producer for greensburg, an american television series broadcast on the planet green television network. the show takes place in greensburg, kansas, and is about rebuilding the town in a sustainable way after being hit by the may 2007 ef5 tornado; it ran for three seasons until 2010.[106]in 2008, dicaprio starred in body of lies, a spy film based on the novel of the same name. it tells the story of three men battling a terrorist organization in the middle east.[107] dicaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he considered a throwback to political films of the 1970s like the parallax view (1974) and three days of the condor (1975).[107] the film received mixed reviews from critics,[108] and grossed $115 million against a budget of $67.5 million.[109] later that year, dicaprio reunited with kate winslet to film the drama revolutionary road (2008), directed by winslet's then-husband sam mendes. as both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to titanic, it was winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by richard yates after reading the script by justin haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster.[110] once dicaprio agreed to the film, it went almost immediately into production.[111] playing a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, dicaprio and winslet spent some time together in preparation, and dicaprio felt claustrophobic on the small set they used.[112][113] he saw his character as "unheroic" and "slightly cowardly" and someone "willing to be just a product of his environment".[114] marshall sella of gq called it the "most mature and memorable performance of his lifetime";[113] dicaprio earned his seventh golden globes nomination for the film.[115] he ended the 2000s by producing director jaume collet-serra's psychological horror thriller film orphan (2009), starring vera farmiga, peter sarsgaard and isabelle fuhrman. although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success.[116]dicaprio continued to collaborate with scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film shutter island, based on the 2003 novel of the same name by dennis lehane. he played edward "teddy" daniels, a u.s. marshal investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island, who comes to question his own sanity. dicaprio and scorsese quickly became interested in the project in 2007, and the former co-produced the film under appian way with phoenix pictures.[117] because of the film's plot involving disturbing scenes, dicaprio had nightmares of mass murder during production.[118] the film was released to mixed reviews; peter bradshaw of the guardian praised the direction and performances but criticized its "silly twist ending", calling it "supremely exasperating".[119] peter travers called it dicaprio's "most haunting and emotionally complex performance yet", and particularly liked his cave scene with costar patricia clarkson.[120] the film was a commercial success, grossing $294 million worldwide.[121]also in 2010, dicaprio starred in director christopher nolan's ensemble science-fiction film inception. inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation,[122] the film features dom cobb (dicaprio), an "extractor" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target's mind.[123] dicaprio was "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life".[124] released to critical acclaim, inception grossed over $825 million worldwide to become dicaprio's second highest-grossing film.[125][126] to star in this film, dicaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, meaning he received a percentage of cinema ticket sales. the risk paid off, as dicaprio earned $50 million from the film, becoming his highest payday yet.[127]after playing demanding roles in shutter island and inception, dicaprio took a break from acting, as he wanted some time for himself.[128] in 2011, he starred alongside armie hammer and naomi watts in clint eastwood's j. edgar, a biopic about j. edgar hoover. the film focuses on the career of the fbi director from the palmer raids onward, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual.[129] reviews toward the film were mixed; critics commended dicaprio's performance but felt that, overall, the film lacked coherence.[130] roger ebert praised dicaprio's "fully-realized, subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself."[131] also in 2011, he produced catherine hardwicke's romantic horror film red riding hood, which is very loosely based movie on the folk tale little red riding hood. although it was poorly received by critics—mary pols of time named it one of the top 10 worst movies of 2011—it had moderate box-office returns.[132][133] he was also an executive producer for george clooney's political drama the ides of march, an adaptation of beau willimon's 2008 play farragut north.[134]in 2012, dicaprio starred as a plantation owner, calvin candie, in quentin tarantino's spaghetti western, django unchained. after reading the script, dicaprio was uncomfortable with the extent of racism portrayed in the film, but his costars and tarantino convinced him not to sugarcoat it.[135] while filming, dicaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming, and tarantino elected to use the take in the final product.[136] the film received positive reviews from critics;[137] a writer for wired commended him for playing a villainous role and his "blood-chilling" performance.[138] the film earned dicaprio his ninth nomination at the golden globes.[139] django unchained grossed $424 million worldwide on a production budget of $100 million.[140]dicaprio's next role was as the millionaire jay gatsby in baz luhrmann's the great gatsby (2013), an adaptation of f. scott fitzgerald's 1925 novel of the same name, costarring carey mulligan and tobey maguire. dicaprio liked the idea of playing a man who realizes his imaginations, someone he characterizes as "a hopeless romantic, a completely obsessed wacko or a dangerous gangster, clinging to wealth".[141] the film received mixed reviews from critics, but dicaprio's portrayal was praised, and earned him an aacta award for best actor in a leading role.[142][143] critic rafer guzman of newsday wrote that dicaprio was not only "tough [...] but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. it's a tremendous, hard-won performance."[144] matt zoller seitz of roger ebert's website described his performance as "the movie's greatest and simplest special effect," and "iconic—maybe his career best".[145] the film grossed $348 million worldwide.[146]three films were produced by dicaprio under appian way in 2013—the ensemble crime thriller runner runner, which the guardian's xan brooks described as "a lazy, trashy film that barely goes through the motions";[147] the thriller out of the furnace, a critical and commercial failure;[148] and the black comedy-drama the wolf of wall street. dicaprio reunited with scorsese for the fifth time in the wolf of wall street, a film based on the life of stockbroker jordan belfort (played by dicaprio), who was arrested in the late 1990s for securities fraud and money laundering.[149] dicaprio wanted to play belfort ever since he had read his autobiography and won a bidding war with warner bros. against brad pitt/paramount pictures for the rights to belfort's memoir in 2007.[150][151] he was fond of belfort's honest and unapologetic portrayal of his actual experiences in the book, and was inspired by the financial crisis of 2007–2008 to make the film.[85] the wolf of wall street received mostly positive reviews for its direction and the comedic portrayal of dicaprio.[152] in his review for the hollywood reporter, todd mccarthy wrote of his "largest and best screen performance, one in which he lets loose as he never has before, is not protective of vanity or a sense of cool and, one feels, gets completely to the bottom of his character" and praised him for playing his role without any caution.[153] the film earned him a golden globe award for best actor in a musical or comedy and nominations for the academy award for best actor and best picture.[154][155] in january 2013, dicaprio said he would take a long break from acting to "fly around the world doing good for the environment."[156]dicaprio was an executive producer on virunga, a 2014 british documentary film about four people fighting to protect the world's last mountain gorillas from war and poaching.[157] the film premiered at the tribeca film festival in april 2014. cowspiracy: the sustainability secret was another documentary film that year for which he was an executive producer—he took part in the new cut released exclusively on netflix that september. it explores the impact of animal agriculture on the environment, and investigates the policies of environmental organizations on this issue.[158]in 2015, dicaprio produced and played fur trapper hugh glass in alejandro g. iñárritu's survival drama the revenant. dicaprio has described it as his most difficult film. he had to eat a raw slab of bison's liver and sleep in animal carcasses, and suffered hypothermia.[159][160] he also learned to shoot a musket, build a fire, speak two native american languages (pawnee and arikara) and apply ancient healing techniques.[159] built on a budget of $135 million, the film earned $533 million worldwide.[161] it was also well received by critics,[162] and dicaprio's performance garnered universal acclaim;[163][164] mark kermode of the guardian wrote of dicaprio's "brainstorming" portrayal and "his turn to triumph with a performance which relies more upon physicality than the spoken word", and nick de semlyen of empire noted his "raw performance helps elevate what could have been just another man-versus-nature drama".[165][166] the film earned him numerous awards, including an academy award, a golden globe, a bafta, an sag and a critic's choice award for best actor.[167][168] also in 2015, he was an executive producer for catching the sun, a documentary film on the growth of the solar power industry that premiered on netflix in april 2016.[169]for the next three years, dicaprio narrated documentaries and served as a producer for films. in 2016, he was an executive producer for the ivory game, which examines the ivory trade;[170] produced, hosted, and narrated the documentary before the flood about climate change;[171] and produced the crime drama live by night. the last of these received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget.[172] he continued to produce films two years later—the psychological horror movie delirium,[173] and the eponymous retelling of the legend robin hood, an action adventure, which proved to be a critical and commercial disappointment.[174]after narrating the 2019 global warming documentary ice on fire,[175] dicaprio returned to acting following a break of four years in quentin tarantino's comedy-drama once upon a time in hollywood, which traces the relationship between rick dalton (dicaprio), an aging television actor and his stuntman, cliff booth (brad pitt). to help the film's financing, dicaprio and pitt agreed to take a pay cut, and they each received $10 million.[176] dicaprio liked the experience of working with pitt; tarantino described the pair as "the most exciting star dynamic duo" since robert redford and paul newman.[177][178] dicaprio was fascinated with the film's homage to hollywood and focus on the friendship between his and pitt's characters. he drew from real-life experience of witnessing the struggles and rejections of his actor friends in the industry.[178] reviews for the film and dicaprio's performance were positive;[179] a critic for business insider called it the best performance of his career and ian sandwell of digital spy particularly liked dicaprio's and pitt's chemistry, which he said helps bring authenticity to their characters' connection.[180][181] he received nominations for an oscar, a golden globe and a bafta award for best actor.[182][183][184] the film earned a total of $357 million against its $90-million budget.[185]in august 2015, it was announced that martin scorsese will direct an adaptation of erik larson's the devil in the white city starring dicaprio.[186] in 2017, paramount announced that it has acquired the movie rights for an english language adaptation of the black hand, which will star dicaprio as turn of the 20th century police officer joe petrosino.[187] later that year, paramount won a bidding war against universal pictures for the rights to adapt walter isaacson's biography of leonardo da vinci. the studio bought the rights under its deal with dicaprio's appian way, which said that it planned to produce the film with dicaprio as the star.[188][189] as of september 2018[update], dicaprio is set to act in and produce roosevelt, a biopic of former u.s. president theodore roosevelt, with scorsese as the director.[190] that october, he was cast in scorsese's killers of the flower moon based on the book of the same name by david grann.[191]dicaprio is identified as one of the most active celebrities in the climate change movement.[192] according to him, he was eager to learn about ecology from an early age, watching documentaries on rain forest depletion and the loss of species and habitats.[193] he has said environment is more important to him than spirituality, and that he is agnostic.[194] he established the leonardo dicaprio foundation in 1998, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness.[195] although concerned with all areas of the environment, it focuses on global warming, preserving earth's biodiversity and supporting renewable energy. it has worked on projects in over 40 countries and has produced two short web documentaries, water planet and global warning.[196] the foundation has also funded debt-for-nature swaps.[197] dicaprio has received praise from environmental groups,[198] and accolades, including the martin litton environment award in 2001 from environment now and the environmental leadership award in 2003 from global green usa.[199] he has been an active supporter of numerous environmental organizations and sat on the board of the world wildlife fund, global green usa, and international fund for animal welfare.[196][200]dicaprio has owned environment-friendly electric-hybrid vehicles and his home is powered by solar panels.[198][201] his use of private jets and large yachts has attracted criticism due to their large carbon footprints.[202] dicaprio states

miserable, just like them. they don't want heroes; what they want is to see you fall."[10] in 1998, he sued playgirl magazine over plans to publish a fully nude picture of him.[244] the new york times' caryn james has credited dicaprio for being one of the few actors to turn his success into "a new form of old-fashioned hollywood stardom that uses celebrity to advance social causes yet rarely lets the public beyond the glittering veil of the photo op".[42] carole cadwalladr of the guardian has said dicaprio is "polite, charming, makes jokes, engages eye contact. and manages [...] to give almost no hint whatsoever of his actual personality."[245]—dicaprio in 2016 on why he loves acting[15]dicaprio is considered one of the most talented actors of his generation.[231][246][247] as he achieved international stardom after titanic (1997), it intensified his image as a teen idol and romantic lead, from both of which he sought to dissociate himself.[59] he has said he feels nervous starring in big-budget studio films due to their hype and marketing campaigns. as an actor, he likes to look at film as a "relevant art form, like a painting or sculpture. a hundred years from now, people will still be watching that movie."[248] he is drawn to parts based on real people, and stories told in specific periods.[15] according to caryn james, dicaprio is unafraid of working on "offbeat projects by first-rate directors", a risk that has led to "misbegotten" projects like the beach (2000),[42] but also to his successful collaborations with martin scorsese on several projects.[249][250] dicaprio has described his relationship with the director as "pretty much a dream come true for me", and admires his knowledge of film, crediting him for teaching him its history and importance.[245] scorsese, on his part, has said, "leo will give me the emotion where i least expect it and could only hope for in about three or four scenes. and he can do it take after take."[251] jesse hassenger of the a.v. club believes both artists have benefited from the projects, which have helped define their careers in the 2000s.[252]agnieszka holland, who directed dicaprio in total eclipse (1995), described him as "one of the most mature actors i've ever worked with", and admired his "courageous" roles choice.[231] she said he does not apply method acting, but is "doing some trick which is pretty mysterious to everyone watching—frankly even for the director. look at him on screen and, for the moment of the shot, he really becomes the character."[231] film critic philip french, writing for the observer, called dicaprio a "superb actor who hasn't yet quite become an adult", and identified a theme of characters in the process of becoming a man. he wrote that dicaprio's inclination toward films about dysfunctional families and characters seeking a father figure allude to his own troubled childhood.[245] dicaprio often plays characters who themselves are playing roles, which according to caryn james "looks simple on screen but is immensely sophisticated".[42] he tends to play antiheroes and characters who lose their mental stability as the narrative progresses.[253][254] dicaprio is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays; colin covert of the seattle times noted how this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries and "redefines film stardom".[255][256]several media outlets, such as people,[25] empire,[257] and harper's bazaar,[258] have included dicaprio in their listings of the most attractive actors. he has said he does not believe in focusing on appearance—as this is only temporary and can negatively affect one's career—and looks for career longevity instead.[259] in 2005, dicaprio was made a commander of the ordre des arts et des lettres by the french minister of culture for his contributions to the arts.[260] in 2016, he was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by time magazine.[261] he was included in forbes' annual list of highest-paid actors in 2008 and from 2010 to 2016 with respective earnings of $45 million, $28 million, $77 million, $37 million, $39 million, $29 million and $27 million, topping the list in 2011. the magazine praised dicaprio's ability to star in risky, r-rated films that become box-office successes.[262] the hollywood reporter's tatiana siegel credited dicaprio for being a rare actor to have a successful career "without ever having made a comic book movie, family film or pre-branded franchise. leo is the franchise."[263] stacey wilson hunt, analyzing his career in new york magazine in 2016, noted dicaprio, unlike most of his contemporaries, had not starred in a failed film in the past ten years.[231] of his success, dicaprio says, "my attitude is the same as when i started. i feel very connected to that fifteen-year-old kid who got his first movie."[178]according to the online portal box office mojo and the review aggregate site rotten tomatoes, dicaprio's most critically and commercially successful films include what's eating gilbert grape (1993), romeo + juliet (1996), titanic (1997), catch me if you can (2002), gangs of new york (2002), the aviator (2004), the departed (2006), blood diamond (2006), shutter island (2010), inception (2010), django unchained (2012), the great gatsby
